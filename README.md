Based on the new screenshots, here's an updated description of the Flutter MovieDB program:

1. **Screenshot 1**: This screen showcases a movie's detailed view, including the movie poster, title, release date, runtime, and genres. Users can also find additional information such as the movie's rating, overview, and cast members.

2. **Screenshot 2**: The app provides a section for displaying similar movies or recommendations based on the user's current selection. This screen suggests movies that share similar genres, themes, or actors, allowing users to discover related content easily.

3. **Screenshot 3**: Users can access the movie's trailer or video content through the app. This screen displays a video player where users can watch the official movie trailer or other related videos.

These additional features enhance the overall movie browsing experience in the Flutter MovieDB program. Users can explore movies in-depth by viewing detailed information, discovering related content, and even watching trailers within the app.
